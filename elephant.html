            <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
            <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidae. Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).
                Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Sahran Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Male Africa Elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can  reach a height of 4m (13ft) and weigh 7,000kg (15,000Lbs).

                <p>All Elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging.
                    Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-lik legs can sarry their great weight. 
                    African Elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian Elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.
                    Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including Savannahs, Forests, Deserts and Marshes. They prefer to stay near water.
                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the ampitheatre.</p>
